Creating a track
----------------
To create a track, you can use the ``create`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack create [OPTIONS] FILENAME NROW NCOL

FILENAME must be a text file. You need to indicates the number of rows and columns of the track.
It creates a track with only blank tiles and open it so you can edit it.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack create track.txt 3 4

This command creates the file ``track.txt`` and open it with this content:

.. code-block:: text

    0;0 0;0 0;0 0;0
    0;0 0;0 0;0 0;0
    0;0 0;0 0;0 0;0

Editing a track
---------------
The ``edit`` command is usefull to open a track with your default text editor and modify it.

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack edit [OPTIONS] FILENAME

The file must be a text file corresponding to a track.


Showing a track
---------------
You can display a track in two different ways:

- writing it in the command prompt using the ``write`` command

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack write [OPTIONS] FILENAME

- showing it in your picture viewer using the ``show`` command

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack show [OPTIONS] FILENAME

For example, we consider the ``track.txt`` file with this content:

.. code-block:: text

    3;1 2;1 3;0
    2;0 11;0 2;0
    3;2 2;1 3;3

The first command will display its content in the command prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack write track.txt

With the second command,

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack show track.txt

We can see this PNG image:

.. image:: img/track.png


Exporting a track
-----------------
Once your track is finished, you can export it to easily share it.

First, you can generate and save the PNG file associated to your track using the ``savepng`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack savepng [OPTIONS] FILENAME

You can specify the name of the output PNG file using the ``-o`` or ``--output`` option.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack savepng -o track_image.png track.txt

Then, you can create a markdown file to generate a little documentation of your track.
To do that, you can use the ``savemd`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    linetrack savemd [OPTIONS] FILENAME

The following options are available:

.. code-block:: bash

    -o, --output TEXT       Name of the MD file
    -n, --name TEXT         Name of the track
    -d, --description TEXT  Description of the track

The markdown file generated can be exported into PDF and HTML.
You can see an example of a PDF file generated by this command here:
:download:`track.pdf <pdf/track.pdf>`
